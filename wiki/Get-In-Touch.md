**[Discord](https://moonlight-stream.org/discord)**: Keep up with Moonlight developments and get in touch with the developers and other users. This is the recommended way to get the fastest help, since many people can answer your questions.

**Email**: info@moonlight-stream.org
We receive a lot of mail and can't respond to all of it, so please research your question on this wiki first. If we don't respond in a few days and you still haven't been able to sort out your issue, feel free to send a follow-up email to remind us - sometimes we miss things in our inboxes.

If you do email us, please include the troubleshooting steps you've already tried and the version of Moonlight you're having issues with.

**Report bugs**: If you have a Github account, please open issues on the Issues page of the corresponding project. Please do not create issues on this project.
