## Meet the Developers
Moonlight was created by [Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu) students as a project at the [MHacks](https://mhacks.org) hackathon in 2013 and further developed at MHacks and HackCWRU in 2014. It's hard to put a cool project down after a hackathon, so we continue to develop Moonlight today.
