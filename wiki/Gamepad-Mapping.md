The [Moonlight PC client](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-qt) contains built-in mappings for most popular game controllers courtesy of SDL2 and the community maintained [list of SDL gamepad mappings](https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB).

If your gamepad mapping isn't included in Moonlight or SDL, you will need to map it in order to use it in Moonlight.

### Mapping Instructions

1. Run this [SDL gamepad mapping tool](https://generalarcade.com/gamepadtool/)
2. Select the controller without a mapping, then click "Create a new mapping"
3. After mapping, click "Set Mapping As Environment Variable" and start Moonlight
