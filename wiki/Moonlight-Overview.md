## App Description
**Introducing Moonlight:** Moonlight allows you to stream your apps and games to another client device on your network or the Internet. You can play your favorite games on your PC, phone, tablet, or TV with Moonlight.

**What it does** This app streams games from a GameStream-compatible PC on your local network or the Internet. After initial pairing, Moonlight will show a list of apps to stream from your PC. You can add any other apps to this list through GeForce Experience. Mouse, keyboard, and controller input is sent from the Moonlight client to the PC.

To have a good experience, you need a mid to high-end wireless router with a good wireless connection to your Moonlight client device (5 GHz highly recommended) and a good connection from your PC to your router (Ethernet highly recommended).
